      <p>With Aria Operations 8.18, there are plenty of new and improved features to explore. One of the standout additions is <strong>Diagnostics</strong>. You’ll immediately notice Diagnostics as it takes the top-left spot in the newly redesigned UI. For full documentation, simply click the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Using-Operations/GUID-2E47145F-0DE5-4D55-A2F2-279E2A475050.html" target="_blank">question mark</a> in the top-right corner.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind, <strong>Diagnostics</strong> requires integration with <strong>Aria Operations for Logs</strong> via the native integration.</p>

      <img src="images/image-1.png" alt="Diagnostics UI Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>So much useful information is now available in one place, all related to VMware Private Cloud. Let's dive deeper!</p>

      <img src="images/image-2.png" alt="Diagnostics Overview Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

      <h2>What are "Overall Findings"?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Using-Operations/GUID-22F8D90C-08EB-4AF3-9C85-D3B73776D0B5.html" target="_blank">"Overall Findings"</a> refer to insights generated from your environment, based on properties and logs detected by the <strong>Diagnostics Management Pack</strong>. This pack includes vSphere benchmarks, log signatures, and much more. The Management Pack is enabled by default in <strong>VCF 5.2</strong> (Aria Operations 8.18) and will also be visible in version <strong>8.18.1</strong>. The pack allows for updates to Findings outside the regular product release cycle.</p>

      <p>Remember, <strong>Aria Operations for Logs</strong> is essential for the Diagnostics feature.</p>
      <p>To dive deeper into each Finding, simply click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Active and Historical Findings</h2>
      <p>Once inside the Diagnostics dashboard, you'll be able to explore a range of findings, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active Findings</li>
        <li>Historical Findings</li>
        <li>Findings by Severity and Type</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Selecting a specific Finding will show more details, such as the object it’s related to and remediation recommendations, including helpful <strong>KB articles</strong>.</p>

      <img src="images/image-4.png" alt="Active Findings Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <img src="images/image-5.png" alt="Historical Findings Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <img src="images/image-6.png" alt="Findings by Severity Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

      <h2>Security Advisories: Stay Ahead of Threats</h2>
      <p><a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Using-Operations/GUID-22F8D90C-08EB-4AF3-9C85-D3B73776D0B5.html" target="_blank">Security Advisories</a> highlight active security issues within your VMware Private Cloud. These are based on discoveries made by the embedded Diagnostics Management Pack. As with other Diagnostics features, <strong>Aria Operations for Logs</strong> is required for this functionality.</p>

      <img src="images/image-7.png" alt="Security Advisories Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong> to get more specific insights, just like you would with Findings.</p>

      <img src="images/image-8.png" alt="Security Advisories Details Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
       <p>Selecting an individual advisory reveals additional information, including the object affected, remediation steps, and helpful links.</p>

      <h2>Managing Certificates in VMware Private Cloud</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Using-Operations/GUID-5CD68A19-F281-4466-9D97-3F739B337702.html" target="_blank">Certificates</a> section, located in the top-right corner of your dashboard, gives you visibility into the expiration status of certificates across your VMware Private Cloud environment. This feature works similarly to the previous <strong>VMware Infrastructure Health Management Pack</strong>.</p>

      <img src="images/image-12.png" alt="Certificates Section Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong> to explore more on certificate health.</p>

      <img src="images/image-13.png" alt="Certificate Health Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Here, you’ll also find options to export and/or update certificates.</p>

      <h2>Monitoring Health Across VMware Cloud Foundation</h2>
      <p>The second and third rows of Diagnostics provide detailed insights into the health of key VMware Cloud Foundation pillars like vCenters, ESXi Host Systems, vSAN, and others.</p>

      <img src="images/image-14.png" alt="VMware Cloud Foundation Health Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>The three out-of-the-box dashboards - <strong>vCenter Servers</strong>, <strong>ESXi Hosts</strong>, and <strong>vSAN Clusters</strong>—are included in the vSphere and vSAN Management Packs. Clicking <strong>VIEW DASHBOARD</strong> on the <strong>vCenter Servers</strong> widget allows you to see your vCenters and their associated services.</p>
      <p>If you don’t see all your vCenters or vCenter Services, ensure that the credentials for your vCenter Adapter Instances are configured with the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Configuring-Operations/GUID-7BEB4011-58DD-4941-885D-574B637FCB9C.html" target="_blank">proper permissions</a>. Additionally, if you’re running vCenter 8.0.3 or higher, the <strong>VMware Service Lifecycle Manager API</strong> service should be set to "Started" and "Automatic." For a full list of requirements, refer to this <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Aria-Operations/8.18/Configuring-Operations/GUID-E590622E-C76D-4C76-97C9-6DE0FA131A2A.html" target="_blank">resource</a>.</p>

      <img src="images/image-15.png" alt="Workload Provisioning Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Click <strong>VIEW DASHBOARD</strong> in the <strong>ESXi Hosts</strong> widget to gain insights into unresponsive hosts, hosts in maintenance mode, or hosts that are powered off or in an unknown power state.</p>

      <img src="images/image-16.png" alt="vMotions Insights Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Similarly, clicking <strong>VIEW DASHBOARD</strong> in the <strong>vSAN Clusters</strong> widget reveals detailed information about your vSAN clusters, including properties and alert statuses.</p>

      <img src="images/image-17.png" alt="VM Snapshots Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      
      <h2>Additional Insights: Workload Provisioning, vMotions, and VM Snapshots</h2>
      <p>The next section of Diagnostics focuses on <strong>Workload Provisioning</strong>, <strong>vMotions</strong>, and <strong>VM Snapshots</strong>—offering immediate visibility into related failures.</p>
      <p>Click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong> in the <strong>Workload Provisioning</strong> widget to see details on VMs being deployed, failed provisioning attempts, and the reasons behind them.</p>

      <img src="images/image-18.png" alt="Workload Provisioning Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong> in the <strong>vMotions widget</strong> for an in-depth view of VMware Private Cloud vMotions.</p>
      
      <img src="images/image-19.png" alt="vMotions Insights Screenshot" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>Additionally, we’ve published a companion <a href="https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=367454" target="_blank">KB</a> to help you troubleshoot any issues surfaced in this section.</p>
      <p>Finally, the <strong>VM Snapshots</strong> widget allows you to view failed snapshots, including those that require consolidation or deletion. Simply click <strong>VIEW DETAILS</strong> to dive deeper into the specifics.</p>

      <h2>Streamlined Diagnostics Replaces Skyline</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Diagnostics</strong> feature in <strong>VCF 5.2</strong> (Aria 8.18) replaces many of the functionalities previously offered by <strong>Skyline</strong>, which is <a href="https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/319011/vmware-skyline-frequently-asked-question.html#:~:text=The%20VMware%20Skyline%20Advisor%20service,details%20in%20the%20FAQ%20below." target="_blank">set to reach its end-of-life later this year</a>. The ability to easily update Diagnostics with benchmarks, log signatures, and rules will continue to improve with future releases.</p>
